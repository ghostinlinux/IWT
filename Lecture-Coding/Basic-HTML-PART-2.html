        <h1 id="a1">LIFE AND CAREER</h1>
        <p>Early life

            Mitnick was born in Van Nuys, California, on August 6, 1963.[12][self-published source?] He grew up in Los Angeles and attended James Monroe High School in Los Angeles, California,[13] during which time he became an amateur radio operator.[14] He was later enrolled at Los Angeles Pierce College and USC.[13] For a time, he worked as a receptionist for Stephen S. Wise Temple.[13]
            Computer hacking
            
            At age 12, Mitnick Mitnick's criminal activities, arrest, and trial, along with the associated journalism, were all controversial.[7] Though Mitnick has been convicted of copying software unlawfully,[30] his supporters argue that his punishment was excessive and that many of the charges against him were fraudulent[31] and not based on actual losses.[32]

            In his 2002 book, The Art of Deception, Mitnick states that he compromised computers solely by using passwords and codes that he gained by social engineering. He claims he did not use software programs or hacking tools for cracking passwords or otherwise exploiting computer or phone security.
            
            John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura, who had both been part of the pursuit of Mitnick, wrote the book Takedown about Mitnick's capture.
            
            Jonathan Littman wrote The Fugitive Game in response, alleging:
            
                Journalistic impropriety by Markoff, who had covered the case for The New York Times, based on rumor and government claims, while never interviewing Mitnick himself;
                Overzealous prosecution of Mitnick by the government;
                National press over-hyping Mitnick's actual crimes;
                Shimomura's involvement in the matter being unclear or of dubious legality.
            
            Further controversy came over the release of the movie Track Down (titled Takedown outside of the United States), based on the book by John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura, with Littman alleging that portions of the film were taken from his book without permission. The case against Mitnick tested the new laws that had been enacted for dealing with computer crime, and it raised public awareness of security involving networked computers. The controversy remains, however, and the Mitnick story is often cited today as an example of the influence that newspapers and other media outlets can have on law enforcement personnel.[33] Mitnick's criminal activities, arrest, and trial, along with the associated journalism, were all controversial.[7] Though Mitnick has been convicted of copying software unlawfully,[30] his supporters argue that his punishment was excessive and that many of the charges against him were fraudulent[31] and not based on actual losses.[32]

After he convinced a bus driver to tell him where he could buy his own ticket punch for "a school project", he was able to ride any bus in the greater LA area using unused transfer slips he found in a dumpster next to the bus company garage. Social engineering later became his primary method of obtaining information, including usernames and passwords and modem phone numbers.[16]
            
            Mitnick first gained unauthorized access to a computer network in 1979, at 16, when a friend gave him the phone number for the Ark, the computer system that Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) used for developing its RSTS/E operating system software.[17] He broke into DEC's computer network and copied the company's software, a crime for which he was charged and convicted in 1988. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison followed by three years of supervised release. Near the end of his supervised release, Mitnick hacked into Pacific Bell voice mail computers. After a warrant was issued for his arrest, Mitnick fled, becoming a fugitive for two and a half years.
            
            According to theIn 2000, Skeet Ulrich and Russell Wong portrayed Kevin Mitnick and Tsutomu Shimomura in the movie Track Down (known as Takedown outside the USA), which was based on the book Takedown by John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura. The DVD was released in September 2004.[37] A documentary named Freedom Downtime was produced by 2600: The Hacker Quarterly in response to Takedown.

            On August 18, 2011, Mitnick appeared on The Colbert Report to talk about his new book, Ghost in the Wires.[38] On August 23, Mitnick was interviewed on Coast to Coast AM during the episode "Hacking & Technology".[39] On August 24, he appeared on the TWiT.tv network's Triangulation episode.[40]
            
            On September 12, 2011, Mitnick answered readers' questions on the technology news site Slashdot.[41] This was the second time he was interviewed on Slashdot, the first time being in February 2003.[42]
            
            Mitnick's story was a partial inspiration for Wizzywig, Ed Piskor's graphic novel about hackers.
            
            Mitnick also appeared in Werner Herzog's documentary Lo and Behold, Reveries of the Connected World (2016).

U.S. Department of Justice, Mitnick gained unauthorized access to dozens of computer networks while he was a fugitive. He used cloned cellular phones to hide his location and, among other things, copied valuable proprietary software from some of the country's largest cellular telephone and computer companies. Mitnick also intercepted and stole computer passwords, altered computer networks, and broke into and read private e-mails. </p>

                Journalistic impropriety by Markoff, who had covered the case for The New York Times, based on rumor and government claims, while never interviewing Mitnick himself;
                Overzealous prosecution of Mitnick by the government;
                National press over-hyping Mitnick's actual crimes;
                Shimomura's involvement in the matter being unclear or of dubious legality.
            
            Further controversy came over the release of the movie Track Down (titled Takedown outside of the United States), based on the book by John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura, with Littman alleging that portions of the film were taken from his book without permission. The case against Mitnick tested the new laws that had been enacted for dealing with computer crime, and it raised public awareness of security involving networked computers. The controversy remains, however, and the Mitnick story is often cited today as an example of the influence that newspapers and other media outlets can have on law enforcement personnel.[33] Mitnick's criminal activities, arrest, and trial, along with the associated journalism, were all controversial.[7] Though Mitnick has been convicted of copying software unlawfully,[30] his supporters argue that his punishment was excessive and that many of the charges against him were fraudulent[31] and not based on actual losses.[32]

            In his 2002 book, The Art of Deception, Mitnick states that he compromised computers solely by using passwords and codes that he gained by social engineering. He claims he did not use software programs or hacking tools for cracking passwords or otherwise exploiting computer or phone security.

            Further controversy came over the release of the movie Track Down (titled Takedown outside of the United States), based on the book by John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura, with Littman alleging that portions of the film were taken from his book without permission. The case against Mitnick tested the new laws that had been enacted for dealing with computer crime, and it raised public awareness of security involving networked computers. The controversy remains, however, and the Mitnick story is often cited today as an example of the influence that newspapers and other media outlets can have on law enforcement personnel.[33] Mitnick's criminal activities, arrest, and trial, along with the associated journalism, were all controversial.[7] Though Mitnick has been convicted of copying software unlawfully,[30] his supporters argue that his punishment was excessive and that many of the charges against him were fraudulent[31] and not based on actual losses.[32]

            In his 2002 book, The Art of Deception, Mitnick states that he compromised computers solely by using passwords and codes that he gained by social engineering. He claims he did not use software programs or hacking tools for cracking passwords or otherwise exploiting computer or phone security.
            
            John Markoff and Tsutomu Shimomura, who had both been part of the pursuit of Mitnick, wrote the book Takedown about Mitnick's capture.
            
            Jonathan Littman wrote The Fugitive Game in response, alleging:
            
                Journalistic impropriety by Markoff, who had covered the case for The New York Times, based on rumor and government claims, while never interviewing Mitnick himself;
                Overzealous prosecution of Mitnick by the government;
                National press over-hyping Mitnick's actual crimes;
                Shimomura's involvement in the matter being unclear or of dubious legality.
